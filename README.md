# R-Data-Processing
This repository contains coursework from the Statistics and Data Analytics class.

The course was taken in Spring of 2020, So I was still new to programming.

This was a hybrid course in which you did statistics by hand and used RStudio to generate your work.
All of the code was written by me and my lab partner with occasional help from other friends. Their
contributions were noted in the files appropriately.
